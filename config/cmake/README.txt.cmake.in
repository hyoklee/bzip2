Please read and be aware of the following:

WARNING:

   This program and library (attempts to) compress data by 
   performing several non-trivial transformations on it.  
   Unless you are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms 
   contained herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, 
   you should NOT meddle with the compression or decompression 
   machinery.  Incorrect changes can and very likely *will* 
   lead to disastrous loss of data.


DISCLAIMER:

   I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE
   USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.

   Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the
   compressed file can be decompressed to reproduce the original.
   Great efforts in design, coding and testing have been made to
   ensure that this program works correctly.  However, the complexity
   of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various
   special cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero
   probability make it impossible to rule out the possibility of bugs
   remaining in the program.  DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA WITH THIS
   PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER
   SMALL, THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

   That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable.  
   Indeed, I very much hope the opposite is true.  bzip2/libbzip2 
   has been carefully constructed and extensively tested.


PATENTS:

   To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any 
   patented algorithms.  However, I do not have the resources 
   to carry out a patent search.  Therefore I cannot give any 
   guarantee of the above statement.
